                        and Social Reform</h2>
                    <p id='byline'>Ireland Option 2</p>
                    <h3>General</h3>
                    <p>Ireland was skipped during the industrial revolution
                        (18th - 20th century) but there were some factories in 
                        Ireland. Dublin was a small urban centre.</p>

                            <span id='blue'>Socialism</span></a> based on political and economic principle
                        that says that all means of production should be owned 
                        by the state and shared equally among population - <a

                            Friedrich Engels.</a></p>
                    <p><span id='green'>Opposition to socialism in Ireland, why?</span></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Fear of revolution</b> - socialism = revolution = collapse
                            of society.</li>
                        <li><b>Rural Ireland</b> - majority = tenant farmers - did not apply, focused
                            on industrial workers.</li>
                        <li><b>Catholic Church</b> - greatly opposed 'godless' ideal. Many socialists
                            were very anti-clerical.</li>
                        <li><b>Home Rule Party</b> - socialism = threat to campaign.</li>
                        <li><b>Unionist Party</b> - made up of landowners + industrialists
                            (wealthy class = anti-socialist).</li>
                        <li><b>Sectarianism</b> - difficult to unite Catholics and Protestants.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Karl Marx had campaigned for the release of Fenian prisoners in British
                        jails. He knew they would support and provide a driving force for a worker's
                        revolution.</p>
                    <p><span id='blue'>trade union</span> an organisation set up to represent the 
                        views and interests of workers - improved working conditions, better pay, 
                        shorter working hours, etc.</p>
                    <p><span id="green">Trade unions in Ireland were for:</span>
                        skilled workers,had links with Britain and had moderate policies.</p>
                    <p><span id="purple">'New Unionism'</span> unions representing unskilled
                        workers - more radical (strike), leaders attracted to socialism.</p>
                    <p><span id='orange'>Unskilled workers</span> e.g. dock workers - worst
                        payed, poor working conditions, lived in constant fear of unemployment, 
                        casual work.</p>
                    <h3>Life in Dublin</h3>
                    <p>majority of working class = unskilled workers.<br> Population growth was due to the expansion of government and trade, 
                        NOT manufacturing.</p>
                    <p><span id='red'><b>Housing</b></span><br>
                        Tenement slums - severe overcrowding. <br> One family (+tenant)
                        = one room. <br> Shared toilet(earth closet) facilities. <br> Unfit for
                        human life, but rents were extremely high. <br> Most families were in
                        debt and had to sell possessions to survive.</p>
                    <p><span id='red'><b>Health Issues</b></span><br>
                        Infant mortality = high <br> TB and other water based diseases
                        were widespread as drinking water ran alongside sewage. <br> 
                        Workers paid by day - bad food - expensive, small amounts.</p>
                    <p><span id='red'><b>Other Social Issues</b></span><br>
                        Crime, alcoholism and prostitution were huge problems.</p>
                    <p>The working class were not interested in home rule, but they
                        were not a political priority until the late 19th century when 
                        labour movements brought in reform</p>
