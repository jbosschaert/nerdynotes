                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>I am an Irish leaving certificate student who, strangely
                        enough, enjoys making interesting, and useful notes. I know . . .
                        what's wrong with this girl?? I ask myself that daily.</p>
                    <p>I hope that my notes, although they may often seem, crazy and 
                        illogical, will help someone with their studies.</p>
                    <p>For a full list of my notes available here go to the notes
                        section, or click <a id='link' href='Notes.html'>here</a>.</p>
                    <p>There is also a section named <a id='link' href='cheerup.html'>"Cheer Up"</a>,
                        you may wonder what this is. Well, I like to stay positive while
                        studying, as I'm sure you do too. Here is a collection of funny pictures,
                        videos, and motivating music which may help you study. Please check it
                        out and STAY POSITIVE!!</p>
